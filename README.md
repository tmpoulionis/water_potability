# Water Potability Classification 🌊🔍

This project analyzes water quality data to classify samples as **potable** (safe to drink) or **non-potable** (unsafe). The goal is to build a cost-effective device using fewer sensors while maintaining accuracy.

## 🛠️ **What Did I Do?**
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzed the dataset for missing values, imbalances, and inconsistencies.
   - Checked if the data aligns with WHO standards for potable water.

2. **Modeling**:
   - Used **Decision Trees** and **Random Forests** to classify water samples.
   - These models handle missing values well and offer great performance.

3. **Feature Importance**:
   - Identified the most critical features to reduce the number of sensors needed in the device.
   - This helps in building a cost-effective gadget without compromising accuracy.

4. **Visualization**:
   - PLotted data histograms to visualize patterns.
   - Created a **Decision Tree Rules Diagram** for better interpretability.
   - Plotted feature importances to highlight key parameters.
